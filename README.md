# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of this educational plan is to create a foundation for basic computer science. The course will be delivered to 6th - 8th grade students who have varying degrees of knowledge and experience with computer usage. 

## Context

### Course 
#### Introduction to Computer Science  <br>
*Grade Level(s):* 6th - 8th  <br>

This intent of this course will be to include the fundamental structure for the AP Computer Science Principles course, and is aligned with the California Content Standards for Computer Science, grades 6-8. If funding is available through the district, a pre-established curriculum that satisfies the requirements of these programs will be selected. If funding is not available, an in-house curriculum will be developed.

The course will include:
* Introduction to basic hardware
* Exploration of data collection and various types of data
* Program/code planning, to include the use of flowcharts
* Basic introduction to algorithms and programming
* Project design, using basic coding components
* Introduction to safety guidelines and protocol development

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

Our site is a small, TK-8, Title I school. Many of our students receive varying levels of academic support services and have IEPs or 504 plans. Our school has recently upgraded to allow for one-to-one Chromebooks. One of our teachers is a part time Technology teacher, with her other time divided between various roles.   

Currently, technology classes are taught by the Technology Instructor through grade 5. These classes provide introductory level computing and typing skills. Grades 6 through 8 skills are left to the discretion of their respective homeroom teachers, and there is no current class dedicated to Computer Science.

As the science teacher for grades 6 - 8, I would like to incorporate computing science skills through an integration with our science program. The skills could be taught sequentially through project integration, and could build from one year to the next.


## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

The devices used for this program include:
* **Instructor Laptop**  <br>
Lenovo Thinkpad E570  <br>
Processor - Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz  <br> 
RAM - 8 GB RAM  <br>
256GB SSD Storage
  
* **Student Chromebooks** (30 Chromebooks in a cart)  <br>
  Linux x86_64 (Chromebook)  <br>
  Chrome Browser Version - 107.0.0.0  <br>
  Chrome OS Version - 15117.86.0  <br>
  CPU - AMD A4-9120C Radeon R4, 5 COMPUTE CORES 2C + 3G (x86_64architecture - 2 processors)  <br>
  4.07GB Storage
  
* **Other Hardware**  <br>
  * Interactive Whiteboard
  * Document Camera

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
