# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of this educational plan is to create a foundation for basic computer science. The course will be delivered to 6th - 8th grade students who have varying degrees of knowledge and experience with computer usage. 

## Context

### Course 
#### Introduction to Computer Science  <br>
*Grade Level(s):* 6th - 8th  <br>

This intent of this course will be to include the fundamental structure for the AP Computer Science Principles course, and is aligned with the California Content Standards for Computer Science, grades 6-8. If funding is available through the district, a pre-established curriculum that satisfies the requirements of these programs will be selected. If funding is not available, an in-house curriculum will be developed.

The course will include:
* Introduction to basic hardware
* Exploration of data collection and various types of data
* Program/code planning, to include the use of flowcharts
* Basic introduction to algorithms and programming
* Project design, using basic coding components
* Introduction to safety guidelines and protocol development

### Situation

Our site is a small, TK-8, Title I school. Many of our students receive varying levels of academic support services and have IEPs or 504 plans. Our school has recently upgraded to allow for one-to-one Chromebooks. One of our teachers is a part time Technology teacher, with her other time divided between various roles.   

Currently, technology classes are taught by the Technology Instructor through grade 5. These classes provide introductory level computing and typing skills. Grades 6 through 8 skills are left to the discretion of their respective homeroom teachers, and there is no current class dedicated to Computer Science.

As the science teacher for grades 6 - 8, I would like to incorporate computing science skills through an integration with our science program. The skills could be taught sequentially through project integration, and could build from one year to the next.

There are several anticipated restraints that I foresee with designing this program. One issue that I foresee is that we have limited funding for new programs. Any software and curriculum development will need to be low, to no cost. We also have strict regulation regarding internet usage and software at our site. For example, "Scratch" coding has been blocked from student use per our administration. This educational plan will need to include sound justification for permission to use programs not already approved for use.


## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

The Edupoint, Synergy Education Platform is used as an online grading platform. As we have one-to-one Chromebooks, the Google Suite of programs are used, and by default, Google Classroom is our current Learning Management System.

Given approval from administration, the following additional software programs/applications and websites would be considered for use:
* *Scratch* - for introduction to block coding and basic algorithmic exercises
* *code.org* - curriculum usage and coding
* *w3schools* - code troubleshooting
* *Github* - additional LMS

### Hardware Specifications

The devices used for this program include:
* **Instructor Laptop**  <br>
Lenovo Thinkpad E570  <br>
Processor - Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz  <br> 
RAM - 8 GB RAM  <br>
256GB SSD Storage
  
* **Student Chromebooks** (30 Chromebooks in a cart)  <br>
  Linux x86_64 (Chromebook)  <br>
  Chrome Browser Version - 107.0.0.0  <br>
  Chrome OS Version - 15117.86.0  <br>

  4.07GB Storage
  
* **Other Hardware**  <br>
  * Interactive Whiteboard
  * Document Camera

### Application

To deliver the content, I plan to use a methodology similar to that used when I teach science courses. This includes the NGSS 5E model: Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. For example, Engagement might be as simple as introducing a "game" or other type of activity (such as a calculator in note formatting), and allowing the students to play and explore for a limited amount of time. Explore includes a demonstration of possible uses for that activity and an introduction to various ways to approach the desired outcome. This may be broken down into multiple, smaller parts. Through Explain, each step is appropriately demonstrated and taught. Students would then have an opportunity to practice these skills and concepts through a variety of deliverables in the Elaborate portion. Evaluations will are discussed in the Assessment section listed below.

Delivery of new content material will include a variety of different strategies, to include (but not limited to): lecture style using PowerPoint, readings, and videos. Step-by-step guidance will be given through a whole-part-whole approach.Individual student needs will be taken into consideration in accordance with their Individual Educational Plan. <br>

**In-class Activities and Assignments** <br>

Most of the content output will consist of activities and assignments to be completed during class time. As many of our students have an introductory level base knowledge of computer science, we will begin with the most basic concepts, to build a solid foundation that they may grow from. <br>

[code.org](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/middle-school) <br>
As someone who is new to teaching computer science, I plan to lean on code.org to help guide my instruction, for a fun and sequential approach. Code.org also offers suggestions for utilizing code in science classes. As the added benefit to being the middle school science teacher in a small school, I can easily integrate concepts and skills from the computer science curriculum into the science classes as an added benefit and practice. Through revisiting these skills and techniques in multiple arenas, students will build a stronger connection to the concepts through real world application. <br>

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) <br>
Scratch will be used to introduce students to block coding and the essentials of functions. This is a high interest program for this age group, and will help with activity completion. This program also allows many different ways to different instruction, through varying levels of challenge and multiple approaches to arrive at a similar outcome. <br>

[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) <br>
This site will be utilized after students have received a basic foundation of coding through block coding. Through tutorials and troubleshooting, students will get a sense of how to write code with languages such as Python. <br>

[GitHub](https://github.com/) <br>
As students become more familiar with coding formats, GitHub will serve as a great platform to share work efforts. This could also serve as a "safe" way (not open to the public) for students to collaborate, and create their own online portfolios to showcase their work.

**Homework** <br>

As a Title I School located in a rural area with limited internet services, homework will be limited to paper-based assignments. Assignments would include activities such as practice uisng binary code, and basic functions. Many of our students also qualify for IEP's and 504 plans, and benefit from differentiated instruction. Homework could offer an additional opportunity for students to practice skills at their level and pace, helping to boost their success with the content. <br>

**Assessment** <br>

Assessments will be made in a variety of different ways. Project completion, traditional quizzes, and a variety of online and paper based activities will allow students multiple opportunities to check in. Assessments will be given periodically and often, so that any issues that arise may be mitigated in a timely manner. Students will also have an opportunity to be assessed in both an individual, as well as collaborative level.  

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.

The development of this Computer Science course will offer students a different perspective to enjoy math and science. Many of our struggling students have a preference for math, and tend to enjoy the hands-on nature of our science classes. Through computer science, they will have an opportunity to excel and have fun while learning. This class will also offer another creative learning opportunity for our accelerated students who would benefit from a unique type of challenge. <br>

Due to the nature of this kind of content, the content is ever evolving, and students will be able to learn nad adapt to these changes. In many instances, students will have multiple opportunities to share their findings and new information, as they often learn about technological advances before their teacher does! (Some of the best lesson suggestions that I have received have come from the students themselves.) <br>

One of many benefits to working in our small school is that their is little to no divide between students, whether it be from social, economic, or racial status. "Gaming" and other technologically based content is something that always brings our students even closer, often being an important common ground that they share. Not only will this class introduce students to the technical aspects of computer science, it will also allow for teaching the important skills for collaboration and group work, which is often needed at this age group. <br>

Should we need to switch to virtual learning, this could be done nearly seamlessly. In response to the school shut-down due to the COVID pandemic, our staff has had the benefit of multiple trainings to best support our online learning community. Due to the nature of the content being taught, computer science lends itself nicely to an online format. Google Classroom also allows for collaborative work and video format that will work well should that be needed. <br>

Overall, this will be an important class to add to our students' repertoire. It will not only open up new opportunities for learning and engagement, it will also allow more opportunities for collaboration. Students will gain a stronger connection and understanding for the technological world that they have been immersed in, and will be able to better evolve with it.
